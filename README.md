Customer Churn Prediction 📊
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the loss of customers or clients over a period. This prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to leave and take proactive measures to retain them.

📈 Project Overview
In this project, we analyze customer behavior patterns to predict churn. We use techniques like data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models to improve the accuracy of predictions. The ultimate goal is to help businesses reduce customer churn rates.
